# ðŸŽ“ College Admission FAQ Bot

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The **College Admission FAQ Bot** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based chatbot designed to answer frequently asked questions about college admissions, specifically for **SASTRA University**. It uses a pre-trained BERT model to understand user questions in natural language and extract relevant answers from a predefined context.

This project aims to simplify the admission inquiry process for prospective students by providing instant, accurate responses to common questions â€” such as eligibility, application deadlines, entrance exams, fees, hostels, and more. The system can be customized for any educational institution by simply changing the context.
